## Report bugs using GitHub's issues

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/yourusername/eth-transaction-interceptor/issues/new).

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Code Style

- Use [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) for Python code formatting
- Follow PEP 8
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Write docstrings for all public functions

## Testing

Run tests with:
```bash
pytest tests/
```
